Hotel Booking Cancellation Dashboard ‚Äì Data Analysis Project

I recently worked on a Hotel Booking Cancellation dataset sourced from Kaggle, and visualized key trends using Microsoft Excel dashboards. üìä

üîç Key Insights Covered:

Trends across 3 years (2015‚Äì2017)

Cancellation patterns by hotel type, customer type, room preferences

Monthly breakdowns of cancellations

Comparative visuals for City Hotel vs Resort Hotel


üß© The first dashboard displays combined data for 3 years, while the following dashboards dive deeper into each year individually (2015, 2016, 2017).

‚úÖ Tools Used:
* Microsoft Excel (Pivot Charts, Slicers, Visual Design)
* Dataset: Hotel Booking Demand (Kaggle)

This was a great hands-on project to sharpen my data storytelling and visualization skills.

üì¨ I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions‚Äîfeel free to connect or drop feedback!
